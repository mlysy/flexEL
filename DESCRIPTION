Description: Provides MCMC algorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution of various empirical likelihood models.  Currently the package supports mean and quantile regression with (optionally) right-censored responses.  The bulk of computations are done in C++ for speed considerations.  The C++ code is exposed as a header-only library for users to conveniently add their own models.
