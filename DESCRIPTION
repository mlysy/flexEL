Description: Various tools for implementing and calibrating empirical likelihood models.  In particular, provides the loglikelihood and gradient functions for arbitrary moment constraint matrices. The inner optimization problem is efficiently computed in C++ using the 'Eigen' linear algebra library.   Also provides functions for implementing right-censored regression models, where the inner optimization is conducted via expectation-maximation.  Users may interface with the library through R or directly through C++, as the underlying C++ code is exposes as a standalone header-only library.
